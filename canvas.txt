<p>Golden, first known as Golden City, was established in 1859 and served as a supply center for miners and settlers in the area. By 1866, Bishop George M. Randall arrived in the territory and, seeing a need for higher education facilities in the area, began planning for a university which would include a school of mines. In 1870, he opened the Jarvis Hall Collegiate School in a building just south of the town of Golden. In 1873, Mines opened under the auspices of the Episcopal Church and in 1874 the School of Mines became a territorial institution and has been a state institution since 1876 when Colorado attained statehood.</p>
<p>The first Colorado School of Mines Board of Trustees meeting was held in 1879, the first formal commencement for two graduates was held in 1883, the first international student graduated in 1889, and the first female student graduated in 1898.</p>
<p>Courses offered to students during the early years of Colorado School of Mines included chemistry, metallurgy, mineralogy, mining engineering, geology, botany, math and drawing. The focus of the early academic programs was on gold and silver, and the assaying of those minerals. As the institution grew, its mission expanded to focus specifically on understanding the Earth, harnessing energy and sustaining the environment.</p>

<h2><i class="icon-syllabus">&nbsp;COURSE BASICS</i></h2>
<p><span>We will be working together for the next 16 weeks in Machine Learning. We have many resources here in Canvas, and links to other on the web. We also have a great team of TAs, lots of in-person and virtual office hours, and support on Piazza. All of the course content, communication, assignment submissions, and grading will be available in Canvas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<hr style="color: #92a2bd; border: 1px solid;">
<h2><i class="icon-module">&nbsp;COURSE STRUCTURE &amp; ASSIGNMENTS</i></h2>
<p>For the first week, I want you to get familiar with the Canvas course, and get to know your fellow classmates. Each week you are expected to work through the content, discussions, quizzes, and assignments in each module.&nbsp;For a detailed view of the class assignments please review the <strong><a title="Syllabus" href="https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/69213/assignments/syllabus">Syllabus</a></strong> page where you will find a running list of assignments and their due dates. The Canvas <strong>Calendar</strong> is also a great way to stay organized with assignment due dates.</p>
<hr style="color: #92a2bd; border: 1px solid;">
<h2><i class="icon-module">&nbsp;COLABORATORY NOTEBOOKS INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT (IDE)</i></h2>
<p>We will also be using the Google Colaboratory Notebooks (Colab) Integrated Development Environment for assignment creation. You may have already used Colab, if so, skip this step. Otherwise, the below will walk you through a Colab introduction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Colab is a free online cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment
<ul>
<li>Check out <a class="instructure_file_link inline_disabled" href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb" target="_blank">Welcome to Colaboratory</a> to get oriented</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now, go to <a class="instructure_file_link inline_disabled" href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true" target="_blank">Colab Notebooks</a>
<ul>
<li>Click on the "NEW NOTEBOOK" button to create a new Colab notebook.</li>
<li>You can also upload a local notebook, recently opened notebooks, a notebook from github, or one from your Google Drive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;In this course, we will be using the Python 3 Runtime type. If you need to change the runtime type, click 'Runtime' on the top menu and select 'Change Runtime Type'</li>
<li>All the notebooks on Colab are stored on your Google Drive. Make sure you are signed into your Mines account so you can keep your notebooks in one place.</li>
<li>Colab allows you to share your work with others
<ul>
<li>Start by clicking the "Share" button in the upper right-hand corner</li>
<li>Get a shareable link or invite others using their email addresses</li>
<li>If a collaborator edits your notebook, it might not always update in real time. To make sure you're seeing the latest code, have the collaborator save their code and then reload your screen</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In order to turn in a notebook, go to 'File' and then click 'Download .ipynb' or 'Download .py' and then upload the file to canvas.</li>

<h2><i class="icon-gradebook">&nbsp;CSCI 470/DSCI 470 GRADING&nbsp;</i></h2>
<p>Most assignments and quizzes will be graded automatically by Gradescope and Canvas. For those assessments that need manual grading, grades will be returned within 7 days of the assignment's due date, unless otherwise noted by the instructor. Grades will be recorded and reported in Canvas. Grading rubrics will be clearly posted on Canvas. Grades are not curved in this class.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The final course grade will be computed from the following course percentage breakdown:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>30% Participation Activities/Exercises</span></li>
<li><span>40% Semester Project</span></li>
<li><span>30% Final Quizzes*</span></li>

<h2><i class="icon-hour-glass">&nbsp;LATE SUBMISSIONS</i></h2>
<p>Late work is strongly discouraged. All work will be accepted within a week after the deadline. Students will lose 20 percentage points for late submissions. After a week, the work will not be accepted at all.</p>
<hr style="color: #92a2bd; border: 1px solid;">
<h2><i class="icon-deactivate-user">&nbsp;ABSENTEE POLICY</i></h2>
<p>Please inform the instructor of potential absence from the class and from online participation, prior to the absence or within 24 hours following the absence.&nbsp;</p>
<hr style="color: #92a2bd; border: 1px solid;">
<h2><i class="icon-like">&nbsp;ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</i></h2>
<p>We follow the <a href="https://www.mines.edu/policy-library/mines-student-code-of-conduct/" target="_blank">Colorado School of Mines Student Honor Code and Policy on Academic Integrity</a>. Work submitted for grading should not be derived from or influenced by work of others. The programming assignments are an integral part of the Computer Science learning experience. These projects will be fun, challenging, illuminating, time consuming, frustrating, and rewarding. Your sense of pride upon finishing is well deserved and your efforts earn your powerful skills and deep understanding. Don’t cheat yourself out of this opportunity! The Honor Code is a powerful community statement that asserts our shared values of integrity. This is a community we are committed to be a part of – please join us! Below are some additional guidelines that apply to CS courses. However, in every course, the instructor has the final say about expectations of academic honesty. There are various ways to use a resource for assigned work and we distinguish them in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>What kind of source is it? Is it a general resource that you are drawing on to do the assigned work, or is it a solution to the assigned work? Does the resource trivialize the assigned task?</li>
<li>How is the source used? Do you consult the source, or do you copy from it more or less verbatim?</li>
</ol>

<p>Google Colab is a free online resource that can be used to complete this course. The only thing that is required is a Google drive account. Your mines e-mails may no longer be associated with a Google account, so you may have to sign-up for a Google account, if you don't already have one. Go ahead and log into your Google drive to start!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Side Note:</strong> Once you have logged into your Google acocunt, I would suggest creating a Machine Learning Course folder that has folders within it such as "Lectures" and "Projects" to help you stay organized for this course!</p>
<hr>
<h2>Making a new notebook</h2>
<p>In order to make a new Google Colab notebook it is similar to making a new document.</p>
<h3>Follow these steps to create a notebook:</h3>
<ol>
<li>To start you click on the new button in the upper left hand corner of drive<img alt="Colab_1.PNG" data-api-endpoint="https://elearning.mines.edu/api/v1/users/8491/files/1909487" data-api-returntype="File" height="595" src="https://elearning.mines.edu/users/8491/files/1909487/preview?verifier=KOnUepFrCITGOYbcB3M05lwfMZt6PA8zXsXlT7Qk" width="1914"></li>
<li>Place your mouse over and hover over the "more" option</li>
<li>You should see "Google Colaboratory" select that and a new notebook will appear!</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="colab.png" data-api-endpoint="https://elearning.mines.edu/api/v1/users/8491/files/1909488" data-api-returntype="File" height="731" src="https://elearning.mines.edu/users/8491/files/1909488/preview?verifier=7VKW1uioOLbFCS5T2kZYF2js5mTzJfiguaZH3rPm" width="823"></p>
<hr>
<h2>Installing Packages</h2>
<p>When you are using Google Colab you must install packages at the beginning of every page, and re-run these installations each time you use you open your notebook.&nbsp; I would suggest copying this and placing it at the top of each notebook you use, including the course lectures:</p>
<div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;"><span>!</span><span>pip&nbsp;install&nbsp;numpy</span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;"><span>!</span><span>pip&nbsp;install&nbsp;scipy</span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;"><span>!</span><span>pip&nbsp;install&nbsp;matplotlib</span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;"><span>!</span><span>pip&nbsp;install&nbsp;librosa</span></div>
<div><span>These are the requried packages used for the course and will need to be used in Colab!</span></div>
</div>
<hr>
<h2>Mounting your drive files</h2>
<p>When using Colab you also have to mount your drive to the notebook if you want to use files for projects and lectures! Note, at this time you will be unable to view images that are supplied with the lectures, but you can download them and still look at the images!&nbsp;</p>
<h3>To mount your drive, add this to the top of your notebook:</h3>
<div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;"><span>from</span><span>&nbsp;google.colab&nbsp;</span><span>import</span><span>&nbsp;drive</span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;"><span>drive.mount(</span><span>'/content/drive/'</span><span>)</span></div>
<h3>Follow these steps to successfully mount the drive:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Run the cell with the above code</li>
<li>Click on the highlighted link to access the code<img alt="colab_3.PNG" data-api-endpoint="https://elearning.mines.edu/api/v1/users/8491/files/1909498" data-api-returntype="File" height="192" src="https://elearning.mines.edu/users/8491/files/1909498/preview?verifier=kInbgrf3mKY82TamknQSUjLHdcoWBBSBhHYrpSKR" width="1758"></li>

<h2><i class="icon-star">&nbsp;WELCOME TO THE COURSE</i></h2>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Hello to all, and welcome to Machine Learning!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">It's an exciting time in the field of machine learning. Over the past 5+ years you may have noticed the huge improvement in technologies such as speech recognition, internet search, recommendation engines, face recognition, etc. This is primarily due to advances in ML, and specifically in a branch called deep learning. And yet, even the tried and true older ML methods are of great utility and continue to be used regularly, especially on smaller, structured (e.g., spreadsheet) data sets. We hope you will find ML as exciting and valuable as we do!</span></p>

My office hours are from 11:30 to 1:30 Mountain time, or by appointment (in which case we may use a different link). I am unfortunately not able to create breakout rooms as I am on Linux, and they have bizarrely not allowed this feature to work on Linux. (Do not ask me why.)

(Assignments) HW 3 question 3 - "palindrome" clarification @ 2024-11-14T02:42:02.091738+11:00:
"For this question, are strings with an odd-numbered length included in the set of palindromes?"

Answer: "11011 has an odd number length and is a palindrome, so it should be able to be recognized by the TM."

Comments:
| ""A man, a plan, a canal - Panama" is a palindrome too, but it wouldn't exactly be practical to work with. I'm asking what strings question 3 of the homework is intended to include."
	| "well, for that to actually be a palindrome it should be amanaplanacanalpanama which is not different to work with compared to other palindromes. It says recognizes some palindrome which means that it should work with any palindrome."
		| "That's how you are defining a palindrome. Other definitions, for example Wikipedia's definition, allow for capitalization, spaces, etc. I am asking how question 3 of the homework defines a palindrome."
			| "Spaces can be ignored in this problem depending on your approach. Gregory Bell is correct."

I was able to get something from the sat examples for what the maxterms look like, but the bindings passed down there are just nil. Any hints or example cases would be very appreciated, thanks!"

Answer: "Bindings is a list of variables like so, '(a b c) or '((not a) b (not c)). It represents all the assignments you've used up to that point, play around with maxterm-bind if you want a better idea."

(Assignments) Does the language in Question 1 accept the empty string? @ 2024-11-11T15:31:29.983076+11:00:
"I know this was addressed in class already, but I have the memory of a goldfish. I would assume not since empty in reverse is still technically equal to empty."

Answer: "Correct! Does not accept empty string"

(Assignments) HW 2 Writing out the Pumping Lemma @ 2024-11-11T09:45:46.601634+11:00:
"If we are using the pumping lemma for CFLs on a language we create for a problem, do we need to fully write out the proof? Or can we just point out specific portions of the proof that don't work?"

Answer: "Fully write out the proof unless it’s a language previously proven to be non-context free"

(Assignments) Order for cnf @ 2024-11-11T05:34:01.237946+11:00:
"Does the order that our CNF expression comes out it matter? For example the example given in the project2.lisp file has: (or a (and b c)) (and (or a b) (or a c)) and ours outputted as: (AND (OR A C) (OR A B)) I know they are equivalent, just wanted to see if it would mess up the test cases."

Answer: "If we're assuming they're using the same logic from Project 1's simplify-regex, it should be the case that it doesn't matter so long as it's equivalent"

(Assignments) How to make grammars in Latex @ 2024-11-10T09:37:28.483994+11:00:
"Is there a package I need to include to make the \bnfor that is included in the starter Latex to work? It says it is an undefined control sequence."

Answer: "Are you trying it inside a \bnfprod{} instance, just within the grammar object, or outside of either of these?"

Comments:
| "I am using the provided latex template for problem 2, so it is inside a \bnfprod{}{}."
	| "In that case I'm not entirely sure -- maybe you have a mismatched bracket somewhere affecting it"

Answer: "Do you have ntdmath.sty? Literally all it does is insert a pipe between two spaces: \newcommand{\bnfor}{\ensuremath{\quad | \quad}}"

Comments:
| "I had ntdmath.sty but it may have been some old version because it did not have that line. Adding that line fixed the problem thank you."

Answer: "I used the align environment"

(General) Office Hours Changed to 11:00 to 1:00 when Possible, 11:30 to 1:00 when not @ 2024-11-09T01:39:40.187777+11:00:
"Unfortunately, my work has assigned me a weekly meeting that conflicts with the end of my normal office hours. As there are not supposed to be any significant meetings on Fridays, this frankly should not have happened. As such, I am moving my office hours slightly earlier. There are other associated schedule conflicts now with the beginning, but these are somewhat more variable. As such, my office hours now begin at 11:00 Mountain Time when I am able to be there early enough - that is most of the time, hopefully. At all other times, they will begin at 11:30 as they did before. Either way, they must conclude at 1:00 for my other obligations. I apologize greatly for any inconvenience this may cause. Please know that I did not choose for this to happen - it was imposed upon me by others."

"Are we allowed to use proofs we have done in class (such as LGAs) as lemmas on the homework as we do on exams?"

Answer: "Luke has said in class that we are free to use any previously proven things on homeworks and exams. They aren’t lemmas though. They are just proofs."

Comments:

(General) Varying Grade Jumps @ 2024-11-05T10:31:14.102252+11:00:
"From B- to A-, the difference in percent to jump a category is 3%. However, the difference in percent for A over A- is 7%, and B- over C is 6%. I was wondering the justification/reasoning for this, thanks!"

Answer: "Great question -- this will make more sense when I draw out the bell curve tomorrow, but it's because they're based on the standard deviation of scores, with a small fudge factor. A-/B+ is on the mean, A is mean + 1 std dev, C is mean - 1 std dev. With this setup (normal distribution based curves) it would be unusual for there to be a fixed percentage between categories."

(General) Exam Score <60% Policy @ 2024-11-05T08:58:27.447767+11:00:
"Since the mean and median midterm scores were below 60%, does the policy of needing one exam score >=60% to prevent dropping one letter grade still apply? Thanks"

Answer: "No, that requirement will no longer apply. The peer evals on the project are being used to prevent "free riding" this semester, not exam scores. Another thing I'll be discussing tomorrow!"

(Assignments) dfa-optimize not correct after all correct steps @ 2024-11-02T05:47:27.371788+11:00:
"So I have a dfa-optimize function that uses Brzozowski's algorithm. I have a dfa that accepts 0*1*, but when I run Brozozowski's algorithm I get a dfa that still matches 0*1* but has more states, thus not getting a minimum. Every step of my algorithm looks correct, I have posted each step below. Thus I am questioning the correctness of Brzozowski's algorithm, or am I missing something in one of my steps? Any assistance would be appreciated. Start with DFA-4 (accepts 0*1*): (reverse (dfa-4)) (nfa->dfa (reverse (dfa-4)) (reverse (nfa->dfa (reverse dfa-4))) (nfa->dfa (reverse (nfa->dfa (reverse dfa-4)))) The result is an output dfa that still matches 0*1* but isn't minimized, although each step of the algorithm looks correct to me. There are no dead states or unreachable states anywhere that might throw off the algorithm. I have also posted my code, I would be incredibly grateful for any assistance."

Answer: "The solution is to make a helper function who before nfa->dfa creates a new start state that is the set of states that the start you made in reverse is epsilon-ed to which does not include the gensym-ed state you make in reverse."

Comments:
| "Sorry, I am a little confused. what does the gensym mean in the gensym-ed state? Also, which nfa->dfa are you talking about, on the first or the second? Do you happen to have a picture or a way to describe this new start state? I would appreciate it!"
	| "My apologies I forgot that we gave you a 'newstart' function. Gensym generates a new symbol for usage, it can be used to create a new state during the reverse function, I presume that you likely used newstart rather than gensym. I am speaking of both nfa->dfa functions, naturally reverse will generate two new start states potentially and we want them both gone. I have a good picture: new0 is the state I speak of, we want it not to exist, we can achieve this through a clever use of e-closure and remove."
		| "Does this make sense?"
			| "Ok, do you think this would work? Create a new state of e-closure of start, called new-set. From new-set, for each node in new-set, draw a new edge from new-set that would have originally existed before creating new-set. In this case it would be two edges, both from new-set to q0 and with values 1, 2. Thanks a lot for the help!"
				| "Exactly that!"
					| "Just don't forget to not include new0 in the FA."
						| "Awesome, thanks a lot, I appreciate the help!"
							| "No problemo."
								| "Is this a correct understanding of how that new state would look after it is created?"
									| "The first one is correct. The second one is incorrect"
										| "How would I correct the second one? Should it have transitions to separate q1 and q2 states that mirror the original ones? Or would it be different?"
											| "Oh wait, my apologies, I misread the second one, I assumed that q1 and q2 did not have self transitions on them but they do. Your answers are correct, my sincerest apologies again."
												| "Are you sure? Bottom left does not recognize "121" while bottom right does."
													| "Dang you are right, sorry again, the result ought to have theset of q1 and q2, but also keep q1 and q2, still the gensym-ed state is gone and thats what matters for nfa->dfa."
														| "Trying to think of the easiest way to implement this, would it matter if we kept the q2 and q1 in the original graph (top right) as well, they would just become unreachable states, as (q1 q2) would have no reason to give them an incoming transition. Disregard, I believe it does matter."

(Assignments) Submitting DES @ 2024-11-02T05:23:45.955834+11:00:
"How do we submit the DES for the first wumpus question, I have read other posts saying that the DES can be quite large. My DES is quite large so I am wondering if we separately submit an svg or have a small picture in the latex."

Answer: "Have a picture in the latex file, it can take up a page if it needs to."

Comments:
| "If it cannot fit in the page can we submit a separate PDF?"
	| "Could you email it to me, I am very curious now."
		| "sent"

-------------------------
(Assignments) move-e-closure and initial :epsilon transitions @ 2024-11-01T06:51:36.363696+11:00:
"For move-e-closure, should we run the e-closure on the set of states initially passed in before transitioning from that set of states on the given symbol? Or only if given in an :epsilon symbol should we run an e-closure on the given set of states?"

Answer: "e-closure should be called at every step regardless of presence of :epsilon symbols."

Comments:
| "So to make sure I understand, for the following NFA, (move-e-closure nfa q0 1) -> (q0 q1 q2 q3)? As opposed to (q1 q2)?"
	| "Yes."

(Assignments) Project 1 Wumpus Question Clarification @ 2024-11-01T06:22:30.633065+11:00:
"Is question 2 referring to any potential map or just the one that question 1 is based off of? In addition, when constructing a specification does this mean we are listing assumptions/rules that the human is doing to avoid the wumpus and escape, or do we need to produce the DES?"

Answer: "I had it confirmed that the specification is essentially creating a DES where you dictate the human moves in response to what the wumpus does. So you could say first the human makes a move, and then based on that the wumpus could do 2 different things and you would decide what move the human should make for each of those moves and so forth. I am also waiting on this answer about question 2a. Assuming you constructed your specification properly, it seems trivial to prove the human can avoid being eaten, you just simply show the eaten state is unreachable in the specification. So I am confused"

Comments:
| "The specification needs to be regular, innately it needn't be a DES, but a DES does work. Yes, it is trivial to prove that a human can avoid being eaten through emptiness."

Answer: "If you make any assumptions you should include them, things like death escape precedence can be relevant and we allow students assumptions to be the truth regarding that. That said of course, assumptions which go against the rules of the problem will not be accepted IE (nonrandom wumpus movement) It is based off the square map from question 1."

"For dfa intersection should the product dfa we return be the dfa which recognizes the language that is the intersection of the languages recognized by the two dfas or literally the intersection between the two dfas (ie. return the dfa of only the states, edges, etc. that are the same in both dfas)?"

Answer: "The former not the latter, which is neatly accomplished by a product function and a nifty helper for the accept states."

(Assignments) Regex->NFA Missing Arguments, Empty Sets @ 2024-10-30T17:22:26.325618+11:00:
"Our interpretation of the regular expressions for the project has been that NIL is the empty set, and that expressions with too few arguments would imply passing the empty set; i.e., $$\left(\texttt{:concatenation}\ \texttt{a}\right)\equiv\left(\texttt{:concatenation}\ \texttt{a}\ \texttt{NIL}\right)\equiv\varnothing$$ $$\left(\texttt{:concatenation}\right)\equiv\left(\texttt{:concatenation}\ \texttt{NIL}\ \texttt{NIL}\right)\equiv\varnothing$$ $$\left(\text{:union}\ \text{a}\right)\equiv\left(\text{:union}\ \text{a}\ \texttt{NIL}\right)\equiv\left\{\texttt{a}\right\}$$ $$\left(\texttt{:union}\right)\equiv\left(\texttt{:union}\ \texttt{NIL}\ \texttt{NIL}\right)\equiv\varnothing$$ $$\left(\texttt{:kleene-closure}\right)\equiv\left(\texttt{:kleene-closure}\ \texttt{NIL}\right)\equiv\left\{\epsilon\right\}$$ Is this the correct way to handle these edge cases?"

Answer: "A concatenation on zero items is epsilon, not the empty set. A concatenation on one item is just that item, again not the empty set. It seems like you're assuming that union and concatenation are only "supposed" to have two arguments. They can have 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. We used reduce to handle this with all cases other than 0, but there may be other implementations that work."

Comments:
| "No, I know they're n-ary, it just seems they aren't well-defined when n is less than 2, hence what I have above. Consider that fa-union and fa-concatenate take exactly 2 arguments, so the reduce would not actually end up calling these if the args list is less than 2. If catenating zero items is epsilon and one is just the item, you're still making an assumption about these "missing" arguments; you're just assuming they get filled in with epsilon instead of the empty set. Why that assumption and not mine, when we already have an explicit symbol for epsilon? Edit: After thinking about it, I can see the argument for assuming epsilon in these places, and having the empty set only ever show up if NIL is explicitly passed as an argument. I'd still like confirmation from Luke or a TA about which is the correct approach, though."
	| "fa-union and fa-concatenation behave exactly as Nate Graves describes. n-ary functions never behave differently with less than 2 arguments, as their definitions are innately recursive, they default to their logical base cases. Concatenation on a single value will concatenate that single value to nothing, and thereby returns only that value. Concatenation on nothing will return epsilon as it is concatenating no values together this leaves a simple empty string. Union on a single value will create an expression which accepts this value and no others, innately nothing happened, and the value is returned. Union on nothing must innately accept nothing, and that is of course what nil is."
		| "This answer is still not satisfying to me; it seems like we're treating catenation and union differently for no reason. There are three basis sets (languages) for regular expressions: $$\texttt{a}\equiv\left\{\texttt{a}\right\},\ \epsilon\equiv\left\{\epsilon\right\}, \text{ and}\ \varnothing\equiv\left\{\right\}.$$ All regular expressions are sets defined by combinations of these basis sets under the three basis operators. We define catenation and union, on regular expressions A and B, as $$A\ B=\left\{ab\ \mid\ a\in A \wedge b \in B\right\}$$ $$A \mid B = \left\{ w\ \mid\ w \in A \vee w \in B \right\}$$ These have obvious n-ary extensions to more than two arguments, but not to fewer. Your description of catenation on one or zero arguments works if the missing argument(s) are assumed to be the empty string. But then for union you seem to assume that the missing argument(s) are the empty set. With the empty string assumption, it should be the case that $$\left(\texttt{:union}\ \texttt{a}\right)\equiv\left(\texttt{:union}\ \texttt{a}\ \epsilon\right)\equiv\left\{a,\ \epsilon\right\}$$ $$\left(\texttt{:union}\right)\equiv\left(\texttt{:union}\ \epsilon\ \epsilon\right)\equiv\left\{\epsilon\right\}$$ not {a} and {} as you suggest."
			| "Literally yes: "Tour description of catenation on one or zero arguments works if the missing argument(s) are assumed to be the empty string. But then for union you seem to assume that the missing argument(s) are the empty set." This is because all n-ary functions have base cases which are their identity values in order to accurately represent what they would do when supplied no arguments. for example: + is n-ary and lisp in fact represents this as if you were to try this code (write (+)) it would evaluate to 0, as the + is adding nothing and so returns its effective form of nothing which is 0, just as concatenate and union return their respective forms of nothing which are epsilon and nil."
				| "All n-ary functions have different identity values innately, as for each of them their form of nothing is different afterall they largely speaking do not do the same operation."
					| "Ok, then we treat them differently. I can buy that. But what is the argument for union's identity being the empty set and catenation's the empty string? I don't remember seeing this in the textbook or slides. Further, which would be the identity for Kleene closure? I suppose it wouldn't matter, as either would just give the empty string, but I'm curious. Thank you for engaging my pedantry, btw."
						| "I think it should be somewhere in one those, but the general reason is this: All n-ary functions by mathematical fact (this is a bigger topic which Dr. Yue's cryptography covers) must have some identity value further this means they can be represented by having infinity arguments even when we supply them with only 2, for instance with +: + 1 2 = + 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... Naturally with only 1 argument this is true: + 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ..., consequently this evaluates to 1. And of course with 0 arguments we get + = + 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... = 0. The same applies to union and concatenation, union's identity value is innately the empty set, as anything unioned with it results in the original value. union (a) () = (a). For concatenation its innate value is epsilon as epsilon concatenated with anything is the original value. concat "a" "" = "a". Thereby when there is 0 arguments it is just: union () () () () ... = () concatenation "" "" "" "" .... = "" kleene-closure is not n-ary its 1-ary, so this does not apply. Does this make sense?"
							| "Yes actually I get it now; thank you so much! One last small thing: Is (:kleene-closure) simply invalid then, or is it the empty string?"
								| "Excellent, Its invalid, we won't test for that."

"Hi everyone, While working on the case study 2 assignment, I noticed that in Feature Learning with PCA, steps 4 and 5, The variables clusters_custom_kmeans_pca and silhouette_custom_kmeans_pca seem different from the naming conventions used elsewhere, where similar variables are named clusters_kmeans_pca and silhouette_kmeans_pca. Could someone confirm if this difference in naming is intentional, or would it be acceptable to adjust the variable names to make them consistent with the rest of the code?"

Answer: "This naming was created to highlight that we are using the custom function instead of the library function. You can change the name as long as you won't mess up those assert tests."

"Hello graduate students, There is a problem with the unsupervised learning - feature learning case study. The custom silhouette score assert test is incorrect. Please change your assert statement from this: assert np.allclose(silhouette_avg, 0.3446, atol=1e-4) To this: assert np.allclose(silhouette_avg, 0.3397, atol=1e-2) The correct calculation should be 0.3397 Dr. Zibo Wang"

(Group project) LLM Project Tips @ 2024-10-24T09:01:06.392242+11:00:
"Websites Many of you have discussed making a website to run your project. There are many ways to do this, but I would recommend streamlit as the easiest library to work with. You can make a website with just a few lines of code. See here: https://docs.streamlit.io/ OpenAI tools OpenAI has many types of APIs, including image generation, moderation (sentiment analysis to see if something is safe), text to speech, speech to text, and more. See them here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models Video Optional, but consider making a video to demonstrate your project. This will help both in class for your final presentation, and if you want to show this to others outside of the class. Long prompts LLMs generally give better responses to longer and more detailed prompts. Try to engineer strong prompts for better results. Publishing/resume This will be one of your largest and coolest projects from your classes at Mines! This is great to put on your resume, and is easy to show off. Plus, you get to say that you worked with “AI”. Consider documenting the project well and trying to publish this on github and your resume. Make sure to check your project with Dr. Wang before making it public. LLM Project example I made an AI recipe generator for my LLM project, feel free to check it out and view the code here. This project was voted best in the class. https://github.com/zcrennen/AIChef. It also has some guides on how to use LangChain and streamlit in the spikes folder. Good luck!"

(Assignments) 5c Autograder Timing Out @ 2024-10-23T06:27:47.856643+11:00:
"Hi, I am finding that the 5c CNN autograder is timing out and I believe it is likely because some of the neural networks take a lot of time to train. Is there a way to fix this? Or will the autograder always fail due to the slow training? Thanks."

(Assignments) Case Study 2 Error @ 2024-10-19T11:52:37.219353+11:00:
"I've been working through the Graduate Case Study 2 and I've encountered this error when working with the PCA data: IndexError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In[22], line 5 2 from sklearn.decomposition import PCA 4 # Perform clustering on the original (non-PCA) data using Custom K-Means ----> 5 centroids_original, clusters_kmeans_original = custom_kmeans(scaled_data[features_to_scale].values, optimal_k) 7 # Compute the silhouette score for clustering on the original data 8 silhouette_kmeans_original = silhouette_score_custom(scaled_data[features_to_scale].values, clusters_kmeans_original) IndexError: only integers, slices (`:`), ellipsis (`...`), numpy.newaxis (`None`) and integer or boolean arrays are valid indices This is the code: from sklearn.decomposition import PCA centroids_original, clusters_kmeans_original = custom_kmeans(scaled_data[features_to_scale].values, optimal_k) silhouette_kmeans_original = silhouette_score_custom(scaled_data[features_to_scale].values, clusters_kmeans_original) print(f"Silhouette Score (Custom K-Means on Original Data with K={optimal_k}): {silhouette_kmeans_original:.4f}") The error is occurring outside of the code that says to add and is part of the already provided code, is there something I should change or edit in this part?"

Answer: "It is hard to tell from this message. A few things you can check: 1. Is the custom_kmeans working properly? 2. Make sure the scaled_data[features_to_scale].values is a Numpy array 3. Make sure scaled_data is a data frame"

(General) Case Study 2 missing autograder block @ 2024-10-19T07:14:36.889266+11:00:
"Case Study 2 was accidentally missing an autograder code block, so it was failing the autograder at all times. I have uploaded a new version of the assignment with the autograder block. If you have NOT yet started the assignment: - the assignment will be fine If you HAVE started the assignment: - please either work off of the new version of the file, or add this code block to the end of your notebook (but right before the feedback section). # Autograding with Otter Grader import otter grader = otter.Notebook() grader.check_all() Please continue to let us know if you have issues with the autograder, apologies if there is a delay in our response.

(Assignments) 5A dropout tests typo @ 2024-10-12T08:20:35.279233+11:00:
"Hi, For the 5a deep learning activity, I think there might be a typo issue with the dropout tests. for i,layer in enumerate(layers): if i not in [1,3]: assert isinstance(d_layers[i], keras.layers.Dense) assert layer.weights[1].shape == [100, 0, 100, 0, 100, 1][i] it enumerates over layers and not d_layers, so I keep failing the shape test with an out of range error since layers has less elements than d_layers. It ran fine in colab but not on the autograder. When I changed the line to this for i,layer in enumerate(d_layers): I passed all the tests on gradescope. I just wanted to point this out incase anyone else was having this problem."

Answer: "I couldn't figure this out when turning it in can we receive points back?"

(Assignments) 5a assignment typo @ 2024-10-09T08:00:47.406221+11:00:
"There is a typo in the 5a deep learning assignment. The number of epochs should be 20 in the description below: Now we'll train the model for 50 epochs with a batch size of 1000. This means the following: The training set will be split into batches, each composed of 1000 samples. Each batch will be processed by the neural network to produce 1000 predications. The predictions will be compared against the targets to compute the losses. The loss values are passed backwards through the network to compute the loss gradients for those 1000 samples. Via the SGD procedure, the averages of those 1000 gradients are used to update the model's parameters. After all batches have been processed in this manner, one "epoch" has been completed. This is done again and again until the number of specified epochs (50) are completed."
