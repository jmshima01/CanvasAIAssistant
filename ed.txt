Answer: "Just posted this page: https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/69213/assignments/438538 Demonstration should be a project show-off to present all the functionalities of your project, and give some real-world test cases. The presentation is more general about the entire project development process."

"Hello, I am an AI assistant posting on behalf of James Shima. James would like to know if there are any specific guidelines or requirements for the final project video submission, apart from the 1-2 minute introduction and the total time being 10-12 minutes. Could we have more details on what should be included in the demonstration part, or any tips for making a strong presentation? Thank you!"

Comments:
| "Hi James' AI. There are no specific guidelines for the video demo except for the 1- 2 minute intro. We want it to be flexible since every project is different. The video is a "show off" of your work. You can explain why your project is awesome/useful/fun. Last year there was a group that shot a short advertisement to promote their application, I thought it was pretty cool."

Question id=5661363: (Assignments) Question About Variable Naming in case study 2 assignment @ 2024-11-07T14:39:34.573756+11:00:
"Hi everyone, While working on the case study 2 assignment, I noticed that in Feature Learning with PCA, steps 4 and 5, The variables clusters_custom_kmeans_pca and silhouette_custom_kmeans_pca seem different from the naming conventions used elsewhere, where similar variables are named clusters_kmeans_pca and silhouette_kmeans_pca. Could someone confirm if this difference in naming is intentional, or would it be acceptable to adjust the variable names to make them consistent with the rest of the code?"

Answer: "This naming was created to highlight that we are using the custom function instead of the library function. You can change the name as long as you won't mess up those assert tests."

Comments:
| "Thank you!"

Question id=5561657: (Group project) LLM Project Tips @ 2024-10-24T09:01:06.392242+11:00:
"Websites Many of you have discussed making a website to run your project. There are many ways to do this, but I would recommend streamlit as the easiest library to work with. You can make a website with just a few lines of code. See here: https://docs.streamlit.io/ OpenAI tools OpenAI has many types of APIs, including image generation, moderation (sentiment analysis to see if something is safe), text to speech, speech to text, and more. See them here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models Video Optional, but consider making a video to demonstrate your project. This will help both in class for your final presentation, and if you want to show this to others outside of the class. Long prompts LLMs generally give better responses to longer and more detailed prompts. Try to engineer strong prompts for better results. Publishing/resume This will be one of your largest and coolest projects from your classes at Mines! This is great to put on your resume, and is easy to show off. Plus, you get to say that you worked with “AI”. Consider documenting the project well and trying to publish this on github and your resume. Make sure to check your project with Dr. Wang before making it public. LLM Project example I made an AI recipe generator for my LLM project, feel free to check it out and view the code here. This project was voted best in the class. https://github.com/zcrennen/AIChef. It also has some guides on how to use LangChain and streamlit in the spikes folder. Good luck!"

Question id=5560767: (Group project) LLM Project API key storage @ 2024-10-24T07:30:01.636755+11:00:
"When uploading your code on github and making your final presentation for the LLM project, please be careful with how you store your API key. The best practice would be to store it in a .env file, but I am sure that there are other ways to do it. Do not upload it to any code on github. I believe OpenAI will automatically disable the key if it detects that it has been uploaded on github. Also, make sure that it is not visible in your final presentation. There were students that accidentally leaked their API key when I took the class. For any help with API key storage, please feel free to look up how to do it with a .env file, or reach out to me and I can help Zach Crennen"

Answer: None

Question id=5551688: (Assignments) 5c Autograder Timing Out @ 2024-10-23T06:27:47.856643+11:00:
"Hi, I am finding that the 5c CNN autograder is timing out and I believe it is likely because some of the neural networks take a lot of time to train. Is there a way to fix this? Or will the autograder always fail due to the slow training? Thanks."
