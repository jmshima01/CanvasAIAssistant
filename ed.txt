Question: (Group project) LLM group project final presentation date survey @ 2024-11-06T03:09:31.195624+11:00:
"Hi all, Since our planned LLM presentation dates are around Thanksgiving, you may have different availability. Please fill out the following survey for your available dates. This will help us make arrangements. Thanks. https://forms.gle/Kb1XJWEntMFJ2q9v5 Dr. Zibo Wang"

Answer: None

Question: (Group project) LLM Project API key storage @ 2024-10-24T07:30:01.636755+11:00:
"When uploading your code on github and making your final presentation for the LLM project, please be careful with how you store your API key. The best practice would be to store it in a .env file, but I am sure that there are other ways to do it. Do not upload it to any code on github. I believe OpenAI will automatically disable the key if it detects that it has been uploaded on github. Also, make sure that it is not visible in your final presentation. There were students that accidentally leaked their API key when I took the class. For any help with API key storage, please feel free to look up how to do it with a .env file, or reach out to me and I can help Zach Crennen"

Answer: None

Question: (Assignments) Question About Variable Naming in case study 2 assignment @ 2024-11-07T14:39:34.573756+11:00:
"Hi everyone, While working on the case study 2 assignment, I noticed that in Feature Learning with PCA, steps 4 and 5, The variables clusters_custom_kmeans_pca and silhouette_custom_kmeans_pca seem different from the naming conventions used elsewhere, where similar variables are named clusters_kmeans_pca and silhouette_kmeans_pca. Could someone confirm if this difference in naming is intentional, or would it be acceptable to adjust the variable names to make them consistent with the rest of the code?"

Answer: "This naming was created to highlight that we are using the custom function instead of the library function. You can change the name as long as you won't mess up those assert tests."

Comments:
| "Thank you!"

Question: (Group project) LLM Project Tips @ 2024-10-24T09:01:06.392242+11:00:
"Websites Many of you have discussed making a website to run your project. There are many ways to do this, but I would recommend streamlit as the easiest library to work with. You can make a website with just a few lines of code. See here: https://docs.streamlit.io/ OpenAI tools OpenAI has many types of APIs, including image generation, moderation (sentiment analysis to see if something is safe), text to speech, speech to text, and more. See them here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models Video Optional, but consider making a video to demonstrate your project. This will help both in class for your final presentation, and if you want to show this to others outside of the class. Long prompts LLMs generally give better responses to longer and more detailed prompts. Try to engineer strong prompts for better results. Publishing/resume This will be one of your largest and coolest projects from your classes at Mines! This is great to put on your resume, and is easy to show off. Plus, you get to say that you worked with “AI”. Consider documenting the project well and trying to publish this on github and your resume. Make sure to check your project with Dr. Wang before making it public. LLM Project example I made an AI recipe generator for my LLM project, feel free to check it out and view the code here. This project was voted best in the class. https://github.com/zcrennen/AIChef. It also has some guides on how to use LangChain and streamlit in the spikes folder. Good luck!"

Question: (Assignments) 5c Autograder Timing Out @ 2024-10-23T06:27:47.856643+11:00:
"Hi, I am finding that the 5c CNN autograder is timing out and I believe it is likely because some of the neural networks take a lot of time to train. Is there a way to fix this? Or will the autograder always fail due to the slow training? Thanks."

Comments:
| "Same here"
| "You can send me your notebook for manual grading"

Question: (Assignments) Case Study 2 Error @ 2024-10-19T11:52:37.219353+11:00:
"I've been working through the Graduate Case Study 2 and I've encountered this error when working with the PCA data: IndexError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In[22], line 5 2 from sklearn.decomposition import PCA 4 # Perform clustering on the original (non-PCA) data using Custom K-Means ----> 5 centroids_original, clusters_kmeans_original = custom_kmeans(scaled_data[features_to_scale].values, optimal_k) 7 # Compute the silhouette score for clustering on the original data 8 silhouette_kmeans_original = silhouette_score_custom(scaled_data[features_to_scale].values, clusters_kmeans_original) IndexError: only integers, slices (`:`), ellipsis (`...`), numpy.newaxis (`None`) and integer or boolean arrays are valid indices This is the code: from sklearn.decomposition import PCA centroids_original, clusters_kmeans_original = custom_kmeans(scaled_data[features_to_scale].values, optimal_k) silhouette_kmeans_original = silhouette_score_custom(scaled_data[features_to_scale].values, clusters_kmeans_original) print(f"Silhouette Score (Custom K-Means on Original Data with K={optimal_k}): {silhouette_kmeans_original:.4f}") The error is occurring outside of the code that says to add and is part of the already provided code, is there something I should change or edit in this part?"

Answer: "It is hard to tell from this message. A few things you can check: 1. Is the custom_kmeans working properly? 2. Make sure the scaled_data[features_to_scale].values is a Numpy array 3. Make sure scaled_data is a data frame"

Question: (General) Case Study 2 missing autograder block @ 2024-10-19T07:14:36.889266+11:00:
"Case Study 2 was accidentally missing an autograder code block, so it was failing the autograder at all times. I have uploaded a new version of the assignment with the autograder block. If you have NOT yet started the assignment: - the assignment will be fine If you HAVE started the assignment: - please either work off of the new version of the file, or add this code block to the end of your notebook (but right before the feedback section). # Autograding with Otter Grader import otter grader = otter.Notebook() grader.check_all() Please continue to let us know if you have issues with the autograder, apologies if there is a delay in our response. Zach Crennen"

Answer: None

Answer: "Sure. I will update those."

Question: (Assignments) 5A dropout tests typo @ 2024-10-12T08:20:35.279233+11:00:
"Hi, For the 5a deep learning activity, I think there might be a typo issue with the dropout tests. for i,layer in enumerate(layers): if i not in [1,3]: assert isinstance(d_layers[i], keras.layers.Dense) assert layer.weights[1].shape == [100, 0, 100, 0, 100, 1][i] it enumerates over layers and not d_layers, so I keep failing the shape test with an out of range error since layers has less elements than d_layers. It ran fine in colab but not on the autograder. When I changed the line to this for i,layer in enumerate(d_layers): I passed all the tests on gradescope. I just wanted to point this out incase anyone else was having this problem."

Answer: "I couldn't figure this out when turning it in can we receive points back?"
